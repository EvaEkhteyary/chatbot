# Q&A Chatbot
I have made this chatbot using Google gemini api, to answer user queries in a conversational manner.

# Install dependencies and requirement.txt:
```
os
streamlit
python-dotenv
google-genai
```
## Changes to be made
you need to add your API key from google in your ".env"

## To run this file, type the following in a new terminal:
```
streamlit run qachat.py
```
